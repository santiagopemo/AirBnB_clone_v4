	    This home is for an easy environment to get away from the city. Great comfort and common life living. Park within walking distance .  Many community churches nearby.  CVS,  Dollar General, Chevron in walking distance.<BR /><BR />Nice corner lot to sit and enjoy a peaceful sunset.<BR /><BR />As my guest, you have access to a large enclosed backyard fence. Great for barbeques and<BR /><BR /> for kids to play.<BR /><BR />Sometimes, I would be available to offer assistance if needed.<BR /><BR />My neighborhood is quiet and people smile but don't intrude upon each other. The school bus lets off students in the evening within 20 feet of the house.<BR /><BR />Public transportation is not available.<BR />Uber is always available.<BR /><BR />There are wild flower that bloom in the spring. Trash is very minimal unless we get an unannounced litter bug.

Make use of the full kitchen if youre yearning for a home cooked meal or take a short, leisurely stroll to the restaurants and have world famous chefs cook a meal for you. Wine bars and shopping at your fingertips.<BR /><BR />Spotless cottage cared for with love by the owners/builders. Perfect central location. Well appointed amenities focused on cleanliness, tech and hospitality. Free coffee and a bottle of red wine welcomes you to wine country. Whether you're beating the summer heat sipping ice cold wine under the shade of the redwood tree on your own back patio, or snuggling under a soft warm blanket savoring Cabernet on the couch, this place has something for everyone and every season.<BR /><BR />A large footprint including a garden and garage/workshop separate the main house from the cottage.

My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business (URL HIDDEN) cabin is a work in progress but it is a nice comfy little place to stay. There is a full bath in the back with shower(the basin of the shower is an old fashioned #2 washtub) ,full size toilet and sink(basin is a little pail).<BR /><BR />Both ends of the cabin are lofted and my plans are to put a bed in each side.As of now the sleeping arrangements consist of a recliner,a couch,and an inflatable mattress.If you are interested in tiny home living,then you should try a night in my cabin.I go up there often just because I like the feel of my tiny home. The kitchen sink is not finished yet but will be soon.There is a nice flatscreen with antenna TV and I also have a pretty good DVD selection there(or just hit a redbox on your way).There is a small fridge,microwave,crock pot, and hotplate as well

	    Old 1937 brick home minutes from downtown Peoria and major hospitals, the zoo and major parks / waterfront. Private room on the second floor available with shared rest of the house. The entire city is within 15 mins by car so a trip to the mall, tourist spots, major business centers or the freeway for a trip out of town is a breeze. <BR /><BR />House is located two blocks from a major bus route. Ubers and taxis are also very easy to call.<BR /><BR />Parking is on street in front of the house. There is a street light at the corner and I usually leave the front porch light on so your car will be fairly lit. As with any street parking I do not recommend you leave valuables in the car. If you are traveling with a lot of stuff I will switch with you and have you park in a locked garage. I can also do that if you are not comfortable with street parking. Just let me know.
